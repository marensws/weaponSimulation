#weaponSimulation
This is a simulation based upon the MASON framework (https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) showing the path nuclear weapons might disassemble and travel between stations.
To run the simulation, you need the mason library (link above) and the JFreeChart library (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/).
